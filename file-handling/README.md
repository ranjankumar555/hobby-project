# File Handling in C - Exploring Commands Implemented Using File Handling Concepts

This project is a hands-on exploration of advanced file handling concepts in C by recreating common Linux file-related commands. Each command is implemented as a standalone C program, providing insights into file I/O operations and system-level programming.

## File and Directory Management Commands

| **Command** | **Description**                           | **C Implementation Idea** |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| [`cat`](https://github.com/ranjankumar555/hobby-project/tree/main/file-handling/cat)       | Display the contents of a file.           | Use `fopen()`, `fgetc()`, or `fgets()` to read and display file contents. |
| [`cp`](https://github.com/ranjankumar555/hobby-project/tree/main/file-handling/cp)        | Copy files.                               | Use `fopen()` for reading, `fwrite()` for writing. |
| `mv`        | Move or rename files.                     | Use `rename()` for renaming or combine `cp` and `remove()`. |
| `rm`        | Delete a file.                            | Use `remove()` to delete files. |
| [`touch`](https://github.com/ranjankumar555/hobby-project/tree/main/file-handling/touch)     | Create an empty file or update its timestamp. | Use `fopen()` with `"w"` mode to create or truncate a file. |
| [`mkdir`](https://github.com/ranjankumar555/hobby-project/tree/main/file-handling/mkdir)     | Create a directory.                       | Use `mkdir()` from `<sys/stat.h>`. |
| `rmdir`     | Remove an empty directory.                | Use `rmdir()` to delete directories. |
| `ls`        | List files and directories.               | Use `opendir()`, `readdir()`, and `closedir()` from `<dirent.h>`. |

## File Content Searching Commands

| **Command** | **Description**                              | **C Implementation Idea** |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `grep`      | Search for patterns in files.                | Use `fgets()` and `strstr()` or regex to search. |
| `wc`        | Count lines, words, and characters in a file. | Use `fgetc()` to count `\n` for lines, spaces for words, and total characters. |
| `head`      | Display the first few lines of a file.        | Read the file using `fgets()` and stop after a set number of lines. |
| `tail`      | Display the last few lines of a file.         | Use `fseek()` to read from the end of the file and display lines. |
| `find`      | Search for files or directories.             | Use `opendir()` for traversal and `strcmp()` or regex to match. |
